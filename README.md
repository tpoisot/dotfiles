# Tim's dotfiles

## Window manager

I use `awesome`. The theme will read the colors from `xrdb -q` (so it will
look just like your terminal). The icons come from Font Awesome, so make
sure to have that installed. The taglist, etc, font is Open Sans Semibold.

## Email

`mutt` + `notmuch` + `offlineimaprc` + `msmtprc`

As far as mutt configurations goes, it's pretty minimal (and if you have
read the usual mutt tutorials you should not be surprised). `vim` bindings
all around.

## Terminal

`urxvt` and that's about it. There are some nice `.dircolors` too.

## Editor

`vim` -- with a sane configuration. It should be ready to go. The theme uses
the colors from `xrdb` too, so it will adapt to your shell colorscheme.
